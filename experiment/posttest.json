        "c": "Hyperbolic fringes are typical in interference patterns due to the geometry of light wave superposition.

        "d": "Infrared light"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "White light helps identify the zero-order fringe because it appears as a central bright fringe surrounded by colored fringes. <a href='https://www.sarthaks.com/2390592/zero-order-fringe-can-be-identified-using#:~:text=1%20Answer&text=Explanation%3A%20When%20the%20white%20light,be%20identified%20using%20white%20light.'>Learn more</a>",
        "b": "Monochromatic light does not provide a clear distinction for the zero-order fringe due to the absence of color variations.",
        "c": "Laser light creates sharp fringes but does not help in identifying the zero-order fringe as effectively as white light.",
        "d": "Infrared light is not commonly used for identifying zero-order fringes in typical interference experiments."

        "c": "The wavelength of light influences fringe spacing and visibility but not the fundamental shape.",
        "d": "The shape of the slit determines the shape of the interference pattern. This is the correct answer. <a href='https://www.sanfoundry.com/engineering-physics-questions-answers-interference-light/#:~:text=Explanation%3A%20The%20shape%20of%20the,the%20shape%20of%20the%20slits.'>Learn more</a>"

        "d": "Thickness increases and decreases alternately"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Non-uniform thickness is a general characteristic, but this answer is too vague to be correct.",
        "b": "A wedge-shaped film typically has zero thickness at one end and increases towards the other end. This is the correct answer. <a href='https://quizizz.com/admin/quiz/609509fc2cdee7001be90d35/wedge-shaped-films-newtons-rings-experiment'>Learn more</a>",
        "c": "Zero thickness at both ends is not characteristic of a wedge-shaped film.",

      "question": "5. If a plane mirror is used in place of a glass plate in Newton's Ring experiment, ____________",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Multicolored fringes are seen",
        "b": "Only bright fringes are seen",
        "c": "No fringes are seen",
        "d": "Only dark fringes are seen"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Multicolored fringes require the presence of both reflection and interference, which is disrupted by the plane mirror.",
        "b": "Bright fringes alone are not observed in this scenario.",
        "c": "No fringes are seen because the interference condition is disrupted. This is the correct answer. <a href='https://quizizz.com/admin/quiz/609509fc2cdee7001be90d35/wedge-shaped-films-newtons-rings-experiment'>Learn more</a>",

        "a": "Fringe width decreases",

        "c": "Fringe width remains the same",
        "d": "Fringe width becomes zero"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A decrease in wavelength reduces the fringe width, which is opposite to the given condition.",
        "b": "Fringe width increases as it is directly proportional to the wavelength. This is the correct answer.",
        "c": "Fringe width changes with wavelength, so this cannot be correct.",

        "d": "The screen is moved further away from the slits"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A multiple of wavelength leads to constructive interference, not zero intensity.",
        "b": "An odd multiple of half the wavelength causes destructive interference, leading to zero intensity. This is the correct answer.",
