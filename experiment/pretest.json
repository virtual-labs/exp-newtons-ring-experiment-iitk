        "c": "Reflection of light",
        "d": "Refraction of light"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Diffraction is the bending of light waves around obstacles, which is not responsible for Newton’s Rings.",
        "b": "Correct. Newton’s Rings are formed due to the interference of light waves reflected from the top and bottom surfaces of the air film between a plano-convex lens and a glass plate.",
        "c": "Reflection alone does not create the ring pattern; interference is necessary.",
        "d": "Refraction involves bending of light at interfaces, which is unrelated to Newton’s Rings."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Diffraction is not responsible for the ring formation.",
        "b": "Correct. The circular pattern is due to the radial variation in the thickness of the air film between the plano-convex lens and the glass plate.",
        "c": "Reflection alone does not explain the circular pattern.",
        "d": "Wavelength influences ring spacing, not their circular shape."

        "d": "t = (2m+1)λ"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Constructive interference (bright rings) occurs when the path difference is an integral multiple of the wavelength.",
        "b": "This represents the condition for destructive interference.",
        "c": "This does not correctly describe the interference condition.",

      "question": "4. Why is the central spot in Newton’s Rings dark?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Due to destructive interference",
        "b": "Due to constructive interference",
        "c": "Because light does not reach the center",
        "d": "Due to the absence of an air film at the center"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Destructive interference occurs at the center because the path difference is zero with a phase change of π at the glass surface.",
        "b": "Constructive interference would create a bright spot, which is not observed.",
        "c": "Light does reach the center but undergoes destructive interference.",
        "d": "While the air film is minimal, interference is the main reason."

        "d": "The rings remain unchanged"
      },

        "b": "Ring spacing decreases, not increases, with a liquid medium.",
        "c": "The rings do not disappear; their spacing changes.",
