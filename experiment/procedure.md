The procedure of determining the wavelength of sodium light using the Newton's Ring experiment is as follows:<br><br>

1. Set up the experiment: A convex lens and a plano-convex glass plate are placed in contact with each other. A source of monochromatic light (sodium light) is directed towards the lens-plate combination.<br>

2. Forming rings: The light passing through the lens forms circular fringes of light and dark bands, known as Newton's Rings, on the plate.<br>

3. Measuring the diameter of the rings: The diameter of the rings can be measured using a microscope or a scale placed parallel to the plate.<br>

4. Calculation of wavelength: The wavelength of the light can be calculated using the formula: Î» = (2 * n * R) / m, where n is the refractive index of the medium between the lens and the plate, R is the radius of the ring, and m is the order of the ring.<br>

5. Repeat the experiment for different orders of the rings and find the average wavelength.<br><br>

Note: The experiment should be performed in a carefully controlled environment to minimize any external disturbances and to obtain accurate results.
