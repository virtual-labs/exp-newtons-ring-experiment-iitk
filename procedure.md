The procedure of determining the wavelength of sodium light using the Newton's Ring experiment is as follows:<br><br>

1. Select any radius to perform the calculation.<br>

2. Click on both ends of the rings to measure their diameter, and observe the values as they appear in the table.<br>

3. Measure the diameter up to the nth ring.<br>

4. Calculate the wavelength using the formula: λ = (D²n+m - D²n) / 4mR <br>

5. Click the Calculate button to determine the wavelength.<br><br>

Note: The experiment should be performed in a carefully controlled environment to minimize any external disturbances and to obtain accurate results.
