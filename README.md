<b> Experiment|   <b>  To determine the wavelength of sodium light by Newtons ring experiment

### About the Experiment 

The wavelength of sodium light can be determined using the Newton's Ring experiment. This involves projecting a collimated beam of sodium light onto a concave glass lens and observing the interference pattern created by the light waves reflecting off the lens surface. By measuring the diameter of the dark and bright rings and using the formula for the interference of light waves, the wavelength of the sodium light can be calculated. The resulting value can be used to determine the spectral line for sodium in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br><br>
